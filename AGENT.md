# AGENT.md

Guide for coding agents (and people) working on Riflay. Read it before
changing code.

## Who it's for

Riflay's users are **not technical**. Every feature must work with zero
setup and one obvious control:

- YouTube Music sign-in is a single **Sign in with Google** button. Never add
  "paste your cookies", OAuth client IDs, or browser pickers.
- Power-user audio settings live under **Settings › Advanced audio**, folded
  away. Everyday ones (Equalizer, Volume leveling, Gapless, Virtual speakers,
  Crossfeed, Mono audio) sit above it in plain words.
- UI looks like a streaming app: dark, the only colour comes from real cover
  art (`AccentBuilder`), no decorative gradients, no emoji, no "AI" styling.
- Error messages the user sees (SnackBars, error lines) are one calm, plain
  sentence: "Couldn't play Song", "No internet connection. Try again." Never
  append an exception, mpv / yt-dlp output, an HTTP code or a URL; those go
  to `debugPrint`.

## Library model

- There is no "source" switch: Home, Search and Library always show files on
  this device, Riflay playlists and YouTube Music together.
- `Track.isRemote` (has a `videoId`) means it streams. Mark those with
  `SourceMark` / `MediaCard(online: true)`. `PlayerController.downloadedCopy`
  finds a downloaded file for a YouTube song; `_sourceFor` plays that instead,
  so `isOffline(track)` is what the UI should show.
- Riflay playlists are `UserPlaylist` (in `models/track.dart`), stored in
  SharedPreferences (`playlists.v1`) and shown as `CollectionKind.playlist`.
- Song menus get "Remove from this playlist" from a `PlaylistEditScope` above
  them (Riflay playlists and the user's own YouTube Music playlists).
- Menus use `useRootNavigator: true`, and their actions use the navigator's
  context (`host` in `_TrackMenu`): the row may be rebuilt away while the
  menu is open.
- Autoplay: `PlayerController._maybeAutoplay` appends the radio of the current
  song when the queue is down to its last two songs.
- The library is saved in its own file by `LibraryStore` (it moved out of
  SharedPreferences' `library.v1`), never encoded on the UI isolate.
  Sorted lists, albums, artists and search keys come from `_LibraryViews`,
  worked out once per library change: add new derived views there, not as
  getters that sort `_library` on every call.
- `PlayerController` notifies for everything (song change, play / pause,
  buffering), several times a song. Widgets that need only part of it use
  `PlayerSelect` (rebuilds when the selected value changes),
  `VisiblePlayerBuilder` (skips pages that are covered) or
  `libraryRevision` (library and playlists only), not `PlayerScope.of`.
  `integration_test/big_library_test.dart` shows a regression (see
  Performance budget).

## How audio works

- just_audio everywhere, with libmpv as its backend on **every platform**
  through `just_audio_media_kit`. Linux uses the system libmpv; the others use
  Riflay's own builds, which have the FFmpeg filters the sound settings
  need: `tool/build_libmpv_windows.sh` (committed DLL),
  `tool/build_libmpv_android.sh` (committed `.so` files in the vendored
  `media_kit_libs_android_audio`) and `tool/build_libmpv_apple.sh` (built on a
  Mac, by CI or by the podspec on first build; not committed). Change one and
  the others should follow: same mpv, same FFmpeg, same filter list. One
  exception: `alimiter` (clip protection) is only used where mpv feeds the DAC
  itself, which Android never does, so Android's build leaves it out.
- `third_party/just_audio_media_kit` is vendored (public domain) to expose the
  mpv player: `JustAudioMediaKit.onPlayerCreated` and `.activePlayer`.
  just_audio recreates the platform player after `stop()`, so settings are
  re-applied in `AudioEngine._applyAll` every time.
- `JustAudioMediaKit.pitch = false`: with pitch on, media_kit overwrites mpv's
  `af` property. The app owns `af` (EQ, crossfeed).
- All settings are mpv properties set in `AudioEngine._applyProps`. Options
  that only apply when the output opens (`audio-buffer`, `audio-exclusive`,
  `audio-samplerate`) need `reopen: true`, which sends `ao-reload`.
- Filters are labelled (`@eq:`, `@preamp:`, `@crossfeed:`, `@hrtf:`, `@mono:`)
  so `signalPath()` can name each stage. New DSP must use a label and add its
  name to the `switch` in `signalPath()`.
- A file in a filter graph (room correction's IR, Virtual speakers' HRIR)
  goes through `AudioEngine.graphPath` and `_lavfi` (mpv's `%n%` length
  quoting). Windows' `C:`, an apostrophe or a bracket in a folder name break
  the graph otherwise.
- Virtual speakers: FFmpeg's `headphone` with `assets/audio/hrir_kemar_48k.wav`
  (made by `tool/make_hrir.sh`, copied to a real file at first use). It runs
  at 48 kHz or the chosen output rate: left alone, `headphone` would move the
  song to the HRIR's rate with FFmpeg's default resampler.
- Mono audio uses mpv's own `format` filters, not FFmpeg's `pan`, so it needs
  nothing from the FFmpeg build. Mono turns Virtual speakers and crossfeed
  off; Virtual speakers turn crossfeed off.
- **Bit-perfect mode** must bypass every stage you add: check `bitPerfect` in
  your getter (see `eqActive`, `crossfeedActive`, `effectiveLeveling`).
- Clip protection (`@limiter`, FFmpeg's `alimiter`) is last in the chain
  wherever mpv itself feeds the DAC (Exclusive mode, ASIO, a direct ALSA card;
  `clipGuardActive`). The DAC's integer format cuts off anything past full
  scale, and Opus / AAC decodes, EQ boosts, leveling and plugins get there; it
  lowers those peaks instead and passes everything within full scale exactly.
  Through the system mixer the sound stays float and the mixer handles it.
- The equalizer's headroom (`preamp`) comes from the curve's highest point
  (`peakGain`, the bands' combined RBJ response), not the loudest band:
  neighbouring boosts add up.
- media_kit has no `setShuffleOrder`, so shuffle is done in Dart
  (`PlayerController._ordered`, `_shuffledFrom`). Never call just_audio's
  `shuffle()` / `setShuffleModeEnabled`.

### Adding an audio feature (checklist)

1. A field + setter in `AudioEngine`, saved in `load()` / `_save()`.
2. Apply it in `_applyProps` (with `reopen: true` if it's an AO option).
3. Bypass it in bit-perfect mode.
4. Show it in the signal path if it changes samples.
5. UI in `lib/ui/pages/sound_settings.dart` with `SettingTile` (it stacks the
   control under the text on narrow windows).
6. A unit test in `test/audio_features_test.dart` and a real-mpv check in
   `integration_test/zz_audio_test.dart` (read it back with `signalPath()`).

- An output device that isn't plugged in (a USB DAC) falls back to the
  system default with a note under Output device; the choice stays saved.
- **Casting** (`PlayerController.castTo`): the queue stays in `player`, paused,
  while a TV plays; `_castFollow` sends each new current song. UI must use
  the controller's `position`, `duration`, `seek`, `play`, `pause`, `volume`
  and `smoothPosition()` / `positionUpdates()`, never `player.*` directly,
  or it shows this device's paused player instead of the TV.
- `services/media_session.dart` (audio_service) mirrors the player to the
  Android notification / lock screen, Control Center and Linux MPRIS.

## YouTube Music

- InnerTube `WEB_REMIX`, **no API key** (it isn't needed, and a key-shaped
  string trips GitHub secret scanning). Signed-in requests add cookies +
  `SAPISIDHASH`; signed-out ones still get home, explore, charts, search,
  albums, playlists and radio.
- Request shapes follow [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi).
  Check its source before adding an endpoint.
- Radio / autoplay: `next` with `playlistId: RDAMVM<videoId>`.
- Playlist edits: `playlist/create`, `browse/edit_playlist` (actions
  `ACTION_ADD_VIDEO`, `ACTION_REMOVE_VIDEO` with the row's `setVideoId`,
  `ACTION_SET_PLAYLIST_NAME`, `ACTION_SET_PLAYLIST_PRIVACY`,
  `ACTION_MOVE_VIDEO_BEFORE`), `playlist/delete`, `like/like`, `like/removelike`.
- Only playlists with `musicEditablePlaylistDetailHeaderRenderer` are the
  user's own; offer edits only for those.

## Vendored packages (`third_party/`)

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `just_audio_media_kit` | Exposes the libmpv player (hook + `activePlayer`) |
| `media_kit_libs_macos_audio`, `media_kit_libs_ios_audio` | Their podspecs use `Mpv.xcframework` from `tool/build_libmpv_apple.sh` instead of media_kit's download |
| `media_kit_libs_android_audio` | Android's `libmpv.so` from `tool/build_libmpv_android.sh` (the FFmpeg filters crossfeed, room correction and Virtual speakers need) instead of media_kit's downloaded one; media_kit's helper library is kept as it was |
| `audio_metadata_reader` | Its FLAC and MP4 writers dropped ReplayGain, lyrics, disc numbers and unknown tags (MP4 freeform `----` atoms) on every save; ours keep them |
| `flutter_inappwebview_linux` | Stub: the real one links WPE WebKit; Linux sign-in uses `linux/login_helper` instead |

Mark every change in vendored code with a `Riflay:` comment.

## Running and testing

The Flutter SDK is at `~/development/flutter/bin/flutter` (not on PATH).

```sh
flutter analyze                 # must be clean
flutter test                    # unit + widget tests
```

Integration tests drive the real app with real libmpv. **Run them only in a
headless Weston, with their own data directory**:

```sh
weston --backend=headless --socket=om-test --width=3840 --height=2160 &   # once
env -u DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY=om-test GDK_BACKEND=wayland \
  XDG_DATA_HOME=/tmp/om-test-data \
  flutter test integration_test/zz_audio_test.dart -d linux
```

- Never run them on the user's desktop session (they open windows).
- **Always** set `XDG_DATA_HOME` to a throwaway directory. The YouTube Music
  session lives under it; without it a test runs signed in as the developer
  and could change their real account.
- `zz_audio_test` routes mpv to `ao=null` (silent) and checks the signal path.
- `dsp_test` renders a test song through each sound setting (`ao=pcm` into
  files) and measures every channel. It needs nothing on the host, so it is
  the check that a platform's own libmpv works: run it on Linux, Windows, an
  Android emulator or phone, macOS and the iOS Simulator.
- `zz_buttons_test` talks to the live YouTube Music service, signed out.
- `zz_responsive_test` sweeps every screen across 90 window sizes; it needs a
  folder of tagged MP3s (see `s` at the top of the file).
- Add `--dart-define=SHOTS=<dir>` to save screenshots, then look at them.
- `flutter test -d linux` rebuilds `build/linux/x64/debug/bundle`. If someone
  has `flutter run` open on the project, that breaks their running app; run
  integration tests from a copy of the project instead.

### Performance budget

`tool/perf.sh` runs `integration_test/performance_test.dart` in **profile
mode** (debug-mode speed means nothing) in its own headless Weston. It plays
a generated 120-song library and wheel-scrolls Home and All Songs, then
prints `PERF …` lines and saves `build/perf/<date>.json` to compare runs.
It fails when:

- the whole app is told to rebuild more than twice a second while a song just
  plays (`PlayerController.notifyListeners`; just_audio re-emits its sequence
  state on every position tick, so only real changes may pass through), or
- a frame's build takes over 8 ms at the 90th percentile, or 40 ms at worst.

Raster (GPU) time can't be measured headless; check that on real hardware
with `flutter run --profile` and DevTools.

The same script takes another target: `tool/perf.sh
--target=integration_test/big_library_test.dart` (8240 songs: load, a folder
scan, song changes and scrolling, as `BIG …` lines) and
`--target=integration_test/cpu_test.dart` (`CPU …`: one core's share while a
song plays and while paused). Compare the old code and the new in two
copies of the project, a couple of runs each.

Memory: `tool/memory.sh [runs]` runs `integration_test/memory_test.dart` the
same way (profile, headless, fresh process per run) and prints PSS / private /
RSS at idle, playing a local FLAC, streaming YouTube and after scrolling.
Compare medians of several complete runs; debug builds are meaningless here.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding code: comment *why*, not what; doc comments on public
  members; 120-column `dart format`.
- A failing network call shows a message (SnackBar via `PlayerController.errors`)
  and never leaves a dead button. A control that can't act is disabled, never
  silently ignored.
- Desktop navigation is one browser-style history (`DesktopHistory`): open
  screens with `ShellScope.open(page, location: …)` so the sidebar can
  highlight them. Phones keep one stack per bottom tab.
- Wheel scrolling: give new vertical scroll views a `SmoothScrollController`
  (or wrap them in `SmoothScroll`).
- Overlays above content (sticky headers) must not swallow clicks: wrap
  backgrounds in `IgnorePointer`.
- Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat(audio): …`, `fix(ytmusic): …`). Don't commit unless asked.
- Never commit secrets, cookies or session files.
