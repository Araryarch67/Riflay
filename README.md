## Build from source

You need the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (stable channel), plus the usual desktop toolchain (Linux: `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `pkg-config`, GTK 3 and `libmpv` headers).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Araryarch67/Riflay.git
cd Riflay
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux          # or: windows, macos, android, ios
flutter build linux --release # build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
```

On macOS and iOS the first build also builds libmpv from source (`tool/build_libmpv_apple.sh`, about ten minutes; needs Homebrew's `meson`, `ninja`, `nasm` and `pkgconf`).

After pulling changes that add packages, quit and run `flutter run` again; hot reload doesn't load new plugins.

## YouTube Music

Everything public works without an account. **Sign in with Google** opens Google's own sign-in page, in its own window on Linux and inside the app elsewhere. Once it lands on YouTube Music, the session is kept in the app's private storage on your device. Riflay never sees your password, and nothing is sent anywhere except to YouTube Music itself.

Changes you make (likes, playlists) go through YouTube Music's own API, so they show up in the official apps too.

## Audio

Every platform plays through [libmpv](https://mpv.io), with Riflay's own build of it where the stock one lacks filters (Windows, Android, macOS, iOS; see `tool/build_libmpv_*.sh`). So the sound settings are the same everywhere:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Playback** (Settings) | Equalizer with presets and automatic headroom, volume leveling (ReplayGain per song or album), gapless playback, **Virtual speakers** (MIT's KEMAR HRTF: two speakers at ±30°), headphone crossfeed, **Mono audio** (both ears, left only or right only) |
| **Hi-fi audio** | Room correction (an impulse response); output sample rate; SoX resampler; buffer size. On desktop also: output device, including direct ALSA hardware on Linux; **bit-perfect mode**; **exclusive mode** (WASAPI on Windows, Core Audio hog mode on macOS); **Native DSD (DoP)** for DSF, DSDIFF and SACD songs; **ASIO** on Windows; **audio plugins** through [Carla](https://kx.studio/Applications:Carla) on Linux |
| **Play on** | DLNA / UPnP renderers and classic AirPlay speakers, found on the network. Files the device can't play (DSD, cue-sheet songs, WavPack...) are converted to FLAC on the fly, YouTube songs go as AAC; AirPlay gets ALAC |
| **Signal path** | Source codec and stored bit depth → decoder → every DSP stage → volume → resampler → output device, with a verdict: *Bit-perfect*, *Lossless to the system mixer* or *Processed* |

Not yet tried on real hardware: ASIO, exclusive mode, and casting to real TVs and speakers (tested under Wine, against a simulated renderer and shairport-sync); on macOS and iOS, everything beyond the automated checks GitHub's Macs run.

## Platform notes

| | Linux | Windows | macOS | Android | iOS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sound settings, signal path | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Output device, bit-perfect, DSD, exclusive | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | – | – |
| Add a folder | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | – |
| AirPlay, TV conversions, tag editor for MP3 / Ogg… (FFmpeg) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | – | – |
| Discord | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | – | – |
| Audio plugins (Carla), see-through window | ✓ | – | – | – | – |
| ASIO | – | ✓ | – | – | – |

Android and iOS give apps no device choice or exclusive output, no Discord connection and no way to run FFmpeg; iOS apps can't scan a folder outside their own. YouTube streams through YouTube's player API everywhere, with yt-dlp (desktop) or a built-in extractor (phones) as the fallback; yt-dlp needs a JavaScript runtime (Deno or Node) for some YouTube challenges.

Nothing else needs installing. FFmpeg (for the tag editor's MP3 / Ogg / WAV…, AirPlay and formats a TV can't play) is a system one when there is one; otherwise the official static build (gyan.dev on Windows, johnvansickle.com on Linux, Martin Riedl's on macOS, about 40 MB) is downloaded the first time it's needed, checked against its published checksum and kept in the app's folder.

The macOS app isn't signed by Apple: the first time, open it from System Settings › Privacy & Security › **Open Anyway**. The iOS `.ipa` is unsigned too; sideload it with AltStore or Sideloadly.

Debug builds append every Flutter error with its full stack trace to `<app support dir>/errors.log` (on Linux, `~/.local/share/dev.riflay.riflay/errors.log`).
